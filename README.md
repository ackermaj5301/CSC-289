# CSC-289 Capstone

# Hi, I’m Joey 👋

## About Me
I’m a student completing my **third degree** this May and a **U.S. military veteran** who values discipline, teamwork, and following things through to completion. I’m balancing school, family, and personal growth while building skills that will carry me into my next chapter.

I’m especially grateful to be part of a cohort where **we’re all finishing together** — that shared sense of progress and support really matters to me.

## My Foo 🎯
My family and my dogs. I have **two Cane Corso dogs** who keep life interesting, and **two children** who are my biggest motivation to keep learning and pushing forward every day.

## Currently Learning
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control  
- 🤖 Using AI as a learning partner  
- 💻 Building confidence through hands-on programming projects  

## Fun Fact
Between school, kids, and dogs, I’ve mastered the art of multitasking — and I still show up and get it done.
