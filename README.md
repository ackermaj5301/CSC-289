# Hi, I’m Joey 👋

## About Me
I’m a student completing my **third degree** this May and a **veteran** who values discipline, teamwork, and seeing things through to the finish. I’m balancing school, family, and personal growth while building skills that will carry me into my next chapter.

I’m especially grateful to be part of a cohort where **we’re all finishing together** — that sense of shared progress really matters to me.

## My Foo 🎯
My family and my dogs. I have **two Cane Corso dogs** who keep life interesting, and **two children** who are my biggest motivation to keep pushing forward and learning something new every day.

## Currently Learning
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control  
- 🤖 Working with AI as a learning partner  
- 💻 Building confidence through hands-on programming projects  

## Fun Fact
Between school, kids, and dogs, I’ve mastered the art of multitasking — and I still show up and get it done.
